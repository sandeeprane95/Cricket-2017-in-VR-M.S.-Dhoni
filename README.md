## Project Description

According to several surveys, cricket is judged to be the second most popular sport in the world after soccer. In case of soccer, there are several game development companies such as EA Sports and Konami that come up with high definition games such as FIFA and  Pro Evolution Soccer (PES) respectively. Until 2007, EA Sports used to develop cricket games but later on stopped the production cycle. As in case of soccer, there are no such cricket games which give the user a feeling of true immersion as a player standing in the middle of the huge stadium with supporters cheering his team. Through this project, the user would get the feel of being a batsman chasing a target set by the opposing team. Every cricket fan would have dreamed to be a cricketer playing alongside their favorite teammates and helping their team win a match from a difficult situation. Our project tries to make those dreams become a reality with the help of VR technology.      

## Application Developed  

In “Cricket 2017 in VR – M.S. Dhoni”, the user gets an experience of how it would feel like when he is at the center of a huge cricket stadium in a tremendous pressure situation where he has to chase a tough target set by the opposition team in a limited set of overs.  

One of the vive controllers is enabled to act as a bat. The user has to use this bat to hit the ball as far as possible in order to score more runs. The user can score 1,2,4 or 6 runs. How many runs does the user score when he hits the ball depends on several criteria such as the distance travelled by the ball, whether the ball crossed the boundary (if yes, whether it crossed the boundary directly or did it bounce before crossing) or whether the ball travelled to a fielder.  

The user must try to avoid hitting in an area where a fielder is present in order to improve his chances of scoring more runs. Moreover, if he hits the ball directly at a fielder (ball didn’t bounce before reaching the fielder) then he would be adjudged as ‘OUT’. Basically, a user will be adjudged ‘OUT’ if he hits the ball directly at a fielder or if he misses the ball and it goes on to hit the stumps.  

As you would expect in a stadium with 50K eager spectators, the crowd would continuously cheer the two teams until the end of the match. This is where our first ambient audio comes into picture. Further, we have our match analyst and pro-commentator ‘John’ who would provide the live coverage of the match from the ESPN Commentary Box. He’d describe various incidences of the match such as single run picked up by the batsman, a huge six, a great cricketing shot resulting in a boundary(4 runs), a stupid mistake by the batsman to give away his wicket cheaply and so on.  

The match would end if the batting side successfully chases down the target set by the opposition side, i.e. batting side wins, or when the stipulated number of overs are completed, i.e. the bowling side wins the match.
